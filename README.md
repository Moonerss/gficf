normalization [(Gambardella et al. 2019)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00734/abstract).
The package also includes [Phenograph](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)00637-6)
[Louvain method](https://sites.google.com/site/findcommunities/)
clustering using [RcppAnnoy](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppAnnoy) library

## Installing From github

`gficf` makes use of `Rcpp`, `RcppParallel` and `RcppGSL`. So you have to carry out
a few extra steps before being able to build this package. The steps are reported below for each platform.

### On Linux
You need gsl dev library to successfully install RcppGSL library.
On Ubuntu/Debian systems this can be accomplished by runnuing the command `sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev` from the terminal.

### On Mac OS X
1. Open terminal and run `xcode-select --install` to install the command line developer tools.
2. We than need to install gsl libraries. This can be done via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). So, still from terminal
```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
and than use `homebrew` to install gsl with following command
```bash
brew install gsl
```

### On Windows
1. Skip this first step if you are using RStudio because it will ask you automatically. Otherwise install  [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) and ensure  `path\to\Rtools\bin` is on your path.   
2. [Download gsl library for Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnu-scientific-library-windows/) from sourceforge and exctract it in `C:\` or where you want.   
3. Open R/Rstudio and before to istall the package from github exec the following command in the R terminal.
```R
# Change the path if you installed gsl librarie not in the default path.
# Be sure to use the format '"path/to/gsl-xxx_mingw-xxx/gsl-xxx-static"'
# In this way " characters will be mainteined and spaces in the path preserved if there are.

# For example for gsl-2.2.1 compiled with mingw-6.2.0:
Sys.setenv(GSL_LIBS = '"C:/gsl-2.2.1_mingw-6.2.0/gsl-2.2.1-static"')
```

Finally after you followed **the above OS specific steps** exec in R terminal the following commands
```R
if(!require(devtools)){
  install.packages("devtools") # If not already installed
}
devtools::install_github("dibbelab/gficf")
```

## Useful Information

Apart from the man pages in R you may be interested in the following readings:

* A [description of t-SNE](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/).

* A [description of UMAP](https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/umap-for-tsne.html)
using algorithmic terminology similar to t-SNE, rather than the more topological
approach of the UMAP publication.

* Some [Examples](https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/umap-examples.html) of the 
output of UMAP on some datasets, compared to t-SNE. 

* Some results of running 
[UMAP on the simple datasets](https://jlmelville.github.io/uwot/umap-simple.html) 
from [How to Use t-SNE Effectively](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/).


## Phenograph Implementation Details
In the package `gficf` the function `clustcells` implement the [Phenograph](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)00637-6) algorithm,
which is a clustering method designed for high-dimensional single-cell data analysis. It works by creating a graph ("network") representing phenotypic similarities between cells by calculating the Jaccard coefficient between nearest-neighbor sets, and then identifying communities using the well known [Louvain method](https://sites.google.com/site/findcommunities/) in this graph. 

In this particular implementation of Phenograph we use approximate nearest neighbors found using [RcppAnnoy](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppAnnoy)
libraries present in the `uwot` package. The supported distance metrics for KNN (set by the `dist.method` parameter) are:

* Euclidean (default)
* Cosine
* Manhattan
* Hamming

Please note that the Hamming support is a lot slower than the
other metrics. It is not recomadded to use it if you have more than a few hundred
features, and even then expect it to take several minutes during the index 
building phase in situations where the Euclidean metric would take only a few
seconds.

After computation of Jaccard distances among cells (custom [RcppParallel](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppParallel) implementation), the Louvain community detection is instead performed using `igraph` or native `Seurat`implementation.
All supported communities detection algorithm (set by the `community.algo` parameter) are:

* Louvain classic (default)
* Louvian with modularity optimization (native c++ function imported from `Seurat`)
* Louvain algorithm with multilevel refinement (native c++ function imported from `Seurat`)
* Walktrap
* Fastgreedy
